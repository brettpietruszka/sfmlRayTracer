# SFML RAYTRACER
Readme is very basic for now. I will iterate on it later.

## Setup
1. Must have sfml installed on computer
2. Use makefile to compile
3. Run executable `./build/sfml-raytracer.out` on macOS or `./build/sfml-raytracer.exe` on windows/msys

## Usage
1. Use the keys wasd and qe to move around the scene. 
2. Use the arrow keys to rotate the camera 

Note: on macOS you must have given the OS permission to use the keyboard via `System Preferences -> Security and Privacy -> Input Monitoring` for whatever terminal you are running the program from or for the executable if you are running it directly.
